# Incident Management Flow via Slack's Slash Command

This node.js app is allowing you to start an incident management process via a [Slack slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands). The command will do the following:
* Posts a Slack message in an incidents Slack channel with links to:
  * A newly created Slack channel for this specific incident
  * A Google Hangout/Meet meeting to join to communicate with your team members
  * A Google Docs template to be copied manually (for now) to share the timelines, notes, logs, etc.

This is what it looks like:
